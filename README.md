## About PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that involves transforming data into a new coordinate system, called the principal component space. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving the most important information. PCA is widely used for data visualization, feature selection, and noise reduction.

## Usage

To use this PCA implementation in your Python project, you can follow the installation below.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucassavioli/principal-component-analysis

2. Go to the project folder:
